			<p class="welcomeText">Welcome! My name is <strong>Lou Bunk</strong> and I am a professional musician, educator and composer living in Somerville Ma. I have been playing guitar for over 25 years and am a professor of Music at <em>Franklin Pierce University</em> where I teach Music Technology, Music Theory, Composition, and direct a Rock Ensemble. Over the years, I have played guitar and bass in many different rock bands, in variety of styles and genres. I studied classical guitar in college.</p>

			<p class="aboutText">I offer <strong>private guitar and bass lessons </strong> (rock, classical, folk, blues, and more) on electric, acoustic, and nylon string guitars. My teaching philosophy is holistic and music centered, focusing on your artistic and technical goals, while learning the music you want to play. Whether you are a beginner learning to strum and change chords, or are an advanced player interested in refining a specific technique,  we can work together to develop a custom curriculum.  Some areas of study could include:</p>	

			<ul>
				<li>Ear Training and learning to play what you hear</li>
				<li>Fretboard geography: how intervals, scales, and arpeggios interconnect</li>
				<li>Improvisation and soloing</li>
				<li>Fingerpicking and Classical style</li>						
				<li>Chord voicing: learning to be creative and dynamic with chord choice</li>
				<li>Technical improvement for speed and accuracy</li>
				<li>Music Theory: the relationships between notes, scales, chords, and more</li>
				<li>Reading music and lead sheets</li>
				<li>Songwriting, Composition and Arranging</li>
				<li>Music Technology: notation, recording, production, and more</li>
			</ul><br>

			<p>
				<em>I can also help you prepare to audition and apply to college/conservatory.</em> 

				<br><br>

				** All ages and skill levels welcome! **	

				<br><br>

				I have over <em><strong>20 years of teaching experience</strong></em> and hold a PhD in Music Composition and Theory from <em>Brandeis University</em> and a Masters in Music Composition from <em>Washington University</em>.
